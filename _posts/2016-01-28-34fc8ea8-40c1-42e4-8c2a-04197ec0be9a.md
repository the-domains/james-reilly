About me

My name is James and I am a senior digital designer. A hybrid of a front end coder and a digital designer although I am more at home in the design sector these days I understand the principles of code and can use it to bring my designs to life in the form of prototypes.

I started off as a coder hacking software, and got a passion for design and the web. My career path has been varied working in traditional print, moving to digital, growing an e-commerce retailer from start up to multi million pound business through innovative design. I moved to a top software house in Belfast as lead front end developer to create apps and websites.

I relocated to Scotland in 2014 and moved into freelancing as I felt this was the next career step for me. In under two years I have worked in over 10 studios helping on projects from a couple of weeks up to 6 months +.

What's next for me? To continue helping studios get a project executed on budget and on time and exceed the clients expectations. 

I am available within two weeks notice so [please get in touch][0]
